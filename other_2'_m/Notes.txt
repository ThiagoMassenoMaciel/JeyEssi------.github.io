Always when something will chage - you must use variable

new things 
prompt("digit your name")
alett("hi fulano")
let varia =prompt("digit your name")

To sum numbers typed per user by prompt convert string to number with function 
Number(variable that have input dtring typed from user )

[] type of data : Number 
[] Maths Operator
[] typeof  
[] Data manipulation
    [] Type convertion : typing casting
    []Number()      ---> its a Constructor function to make the string becomes Number 
    []String()      ---> its a Constructor function to make the Number becomes string
[] Operator order by precedensce
  look the diference
    let result2 = Number(n3) + Number(n4)/2;   !==  let result2 =  (Number(n3) + Number(n4))  /2;

[] Group

the VIRGULA doesn't work to separate literals + string have to use + concatenat

PROGRAMATION LOGIC 
UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS 
CRITICAL THINKING AND LOGIC

It's necessary to think 
takes a long time , mainly for beginners
HOW ?    making asks - 

QUESTIONATE and UNDERSTAND
Good asks , good responses 
          to understand =  to ask until you find the solution
          UNDERSTAND 
          1 -> read     \__ the problem
          2 -> Interpret/

PRACTICE 
-> more and more 
-> take a long time to get ready , really .
-> remember to make big problem becomes small problems

teory + pratica
ALGORITHM DATA STRUCTURE      get  \
-> Its all about   ->       display \___   of data .
                          managment /
->Sequences of step by step to make one task


READ CODE 
-> Starts to see code from others and try to understand more 
-> See other ways to solve problems beyond mine 
-> Learn others algorithms
-> Explain what code do ;
-> Find good and bad code . HOW I KNOW ? after a lot of experience

Good habbits : Don't repeat code    WHY : Because the next upgrade you'll just to need to change few lines of code .
