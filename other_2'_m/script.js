Find something to solve the problem : 

  i put the code alert("Hi fulano ") -----------But dont show my name 
  SOLUTION ? you must to get the name

  i put the code  prompt("Appprer to the user") ----------- but you put after the alert how could  you get first step to know the name if you put the code one last step ? 
  SOLUTION : put this code above the alert


  I Â´put this order 
  SOLVED : mensage display
  SOLVED : get the name 
  SOLVED : ORDER code 


  prompt("digit your name")
  alert("Hi fulano , tudo bom  ?") ---------------but i still  note saw my name that i write into the prompt----
  SOLUTION :  its because the name returns to n'one place -> how could you use the name if you never GUARDOU stored the information ? 

    use variable to receiv what will return after the function be called
    let variable = all function

  let = prompt("Digit your name")  



  i put the function on code , at first line and i still note seeing that name one a display alert
  SOLUTION concatenate literal + strings 

  The user need to store them name to some place , and see that on a screen him name with a phrase togeher

  steps: Ask him name 
          stored that striing on a variable 
              display that variable together a frase Hi fulano , how are you ?

  Hi [Fulano] , how are you ?

  [] execute functions
  [] variables
  [] concatenate literals + strings


  =================>
  promt("Parameter is what will display to your user ") this function will catch what user digitted and return to the place it was called

  alert ("will create a box on screen front page html on a web and with a mensage digit beetween this doble quotes")

  ------------help :
    identificates what you already now to do . And do it .
    Break the big probles to a small problems

    things will be changed : name fulano never allways will be the same 
    maybe a person typped others names 

*/

let variable1 = prompt("Digit your name :")
alert(`Hi ${variable1} , how are you ?`)

// I write my name but the next command ALERT doesn't show me the phrase with my name together 
//How could we solve that ?
